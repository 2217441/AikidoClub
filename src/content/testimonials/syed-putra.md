Joining IIUM Aikido Club was one of the best decisions I've made. The instructors are not only skilled but incredibly patient and supportive. The sense of community within the club is empowering, and I've gained not only Aikido skills but also lifelong friendships. It's a journey of self-discovery and personal growth. Highly recommended!
